# coffee-shops-analysis
This project involved a detailed analysis of the sales data , aiming to identify trends, customer preferences, and areas for improvement. Utilizing various data visualization tools and statistical methods, I examined monthly and seasonal sales patterns, evaluated the performance of individual menu items, and assessed the impact of promotional campaigns.

Key components of the analysis included:

Sales Trend Analysis: Reviewed sales data over the past year to identify peak periods and fluctuations in customer traffic.

Menu Item Performance: Analyzed sales by category and individual items, highlighting top performers and underperformers.

The final report provided actionable recommendations to enhance sales strategies, optimize inventory management, and improve customer satisfaction.
